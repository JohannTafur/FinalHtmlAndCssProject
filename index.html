                            a bloody war broke out between Elyos and the Fallen Dragon. During the conflict, the
                            inhabitants of Elyos summoned heroes from other worlds to help them: the so-called
                            Crests. Warriors from different nations fought together alongside them and eventually
                            succeeded in banishing the Fallen Dragon.
